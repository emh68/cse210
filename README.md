# CSE 210: Programming with Classes

This repository contains starter code and resources for the **CSE 210** course, focusing on programming with classes. Below is an overview of the course structure, assignments, and learning outcomes.

## **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

- **sandbox**: An empty project for experimenting with concepts.
- **csharp-prep**: Starter projects for C# Prep assignments.
- **prepare**: Starter projects for preparation learning activities.
- **prove**: Starter projects for weekly "Prove" Developer projects.
- **final**: Starter projects for the final project.

## **Course Overview**

Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher, once said, *"There is nothing permanent except change."* This principle applies strongly to software, where the need for updating and maintaining code is constant. The cost of change can be high, but **programming with classes** makes software easier and more cost-effective to modify.

This course introduces the principles of **classes** and **objects**, with a focus on **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

---

## **Course Outcomes**

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Articulate the principles of programming with classes.
2. Design software using the principles of programming with classes.
3. Develop working software using techniques of programming with classes.

## **Technologies Used**

- **C#**: Primary programming language for projects.
- **Microsoft Teams/Zoom**: Collaboration tools for team activities.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and code sharing.
