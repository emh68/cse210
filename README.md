# CSE 210: Programming with Classes

This repository contains code and resources for the **CSE 210** course, focusing on programming with classes. Below is an overview of the course structure, assignments, and learning outcomes.

## **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

- **sandbox**: An empty project for experimenting with concepts.
- **csharp-prep**: projects for C# Prep assignments.
- **prepare**: projects for preparation learning activities.
- **prove**: projects for weekly "Prove" Developer projects.
- **final**: projects for the final project.

## **Course Overview**

Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher, once said, *"There is nothing permanent except change."* This principle applies strongly to software, where the need for updating and maintaining code is constant. The cost of change can be high, but **programming with classes** makes software easier and more cost-effective to modify.

This course introduces the principles of **classes** and **objects**, with a focus on **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

## **Course Outcomes**

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Articulate the principles of programming with classes.
2. Design software using the principles of programming with classes.
3. Develop working software using techniques of programming with classes.

|------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Introduction    | Overview of object-oriented programming and course structure.                                 |
| 2    | Abstraction     | Understanding abstraction to manage complexity in software design.                            |
| 3    | Encapsulation   | Learning encapsulation to protect data and ensure modularity.                                 |
| 4    | Inheritance     | Exploring inheritance to promote code reuse and establish relationships between classes.      |
| 5    | Polymorphism    | Implementing polymorphism to allow for flexible and interchangeable code components.          |
| 6    | Final Project   | Applying all learned principles in a comprehensive software development project.              |
| 7    | Conclusion      | Reflecting on the course content and solidifying understanding of programming with classes.   |

## **Technologies Used**

- **C#**: Primary programming language for projects.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and code sharing.

## **Final Project**

In Weeks 6 and 7, students design and complete a **final project** that applies all principles of programming with classes. This project serves as a culmination of the course and demonstrates the student's ability to develop high-quality software.

You can view the final project at the following link:<br>
